# Recommended Tools for Client Modding
<li>[Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 with .NET SDK](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and/or [Visual Studio Code w/ C# Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/)</li>
<li>[Unity Explorer](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer) as it allows you to examine and edit GameObjects in scenes (trust me it's *really* helpful)</li>
